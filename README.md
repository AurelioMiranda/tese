# RAMSES Thesis Report

Welcome to the official repository for my Master's thesis project â€” **RAMSES: A CONFIGURATION LANGUAGE FOR AUTOMATIC CODE GENERATION IN AN INDUSTRIAL CONTEXT.**.

This work focuses on model-driven engineering (MDE), specifically leveraging **Acceleo-based model-to-text transformation** techniques to customize generated **C/C++ code** from high-level models.  
The project is part of my ongoing research in the field of system-level design and automation, exploring how transformations can streamline code generation and improve software engineering processes.

## Project Objectives

- Definition of a configuration language for parameterizing the RAMSES code generation process.
- Introduction of mechanisms to enable customized C/C++ code generation, supporting various coding styles, library integrations, and API choices.
- Provision for reusing company libraries that already exist, enabling smoother integration of RAMSES into industrial development processes.
- The facilitation of reusing company libraries that already exist, enabling smoother integration of RAMSES into industrial development processes.
